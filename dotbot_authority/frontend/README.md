# Frontend for DotBot Authority

Getting started:
```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
# build and run the development server
npm run dev
# or just build it (results are put in the `dist` folder)
npm run build
```

You'll need the following installed in your system:
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (tested with version 12.22.9)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (tested with 10.2.4)

Note for contributors: this is a [react](https://react.dev/) project, and the build and development server are handled by [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
